# Open Underglow Controller (OUC)
This project is designed to provide a better underglow control scheme than the one that comes with the LED strips. It has it's own controls, a small OLED screen, and a connector to the CANBUS for connecting to the car.

OUC uses an ESP32 for it's superior speed and memory size over an arduino.

Currently, there is no Bluetooth app, but there is palns for creating one in the future.

There are three wires out that can be wired to the turn signals and brake lights to have the underglow act as additional lights. There are several modes for this as well.

A full hardware list can be found in docs/hardware.md
