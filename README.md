# Open Underglow Controller (OUC)
This project is designed to provide a better underglow control scheme than the one that comes with the LED strips. It has it's own controls, a small OLED screen, and a connector to the CANBUS for connecting to the car.

OUC uses an ESP32 for it's superior speed and memory size over an arduino.
